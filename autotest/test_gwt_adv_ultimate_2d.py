"""
Test the ULTIMATE advection scheme where flow runs oblique to the grid.

A step front is advected across a square grid by a uniform flow field, once
along the grid and once at 45 degrees, at the same cell size, the same velocity
component along each axis and the same Courant number per direction.  The
exact answer is a step that has travelled a known distance, so both cases can be
measured directly.

The oblique case is the one that matters.  Along the grid every transverse and
twist term of the reconstruction vanishes identically and the scheme reduces to
one-dimensional QUICKEST, so the aligned case only confirms that the
multidimensional terms stay out of the way when they should.  At 45 degrees they
are as large as they get, and they are what holds the solution together: with
the face-normal terms alone this problem reaches a concentration of 2.8 and
minus 0.97 while still satisfying the Courant constraint, because the
one-dimensional limiter bounds each face on the assumption that the face carries
the only flux leaving the cell, and an obliquely flowing cell discharges through
two faces at once.  With the full reconstruction the same run stays inside
[0, 1.06] and its error halves.

Some overshoot survives, as it does in MT3DMS, which overshoots slightly more
than this on the same problem.  Multidimensional monotonicity is not guaranteed
by a limiter derived in one dimension, so the test bounds the overshoot rather
than forbidding it.
